            <p>
              My name is Rokib hasan . I am from at Thakurgoan, rangpur. I am a
              student Honors 1 st year depertment of Mathematics . and i am a
              learner at programing hero Web devlopment course batch 5. Every
              person must have a goal in life. I also have a goal to become a
              full stack web developer in future. To achieve my goal, I will do
              hard work more and more. I know the way to achieve my goal is not
              easy but I will never give up. I always believe in myself. "I Can"
              - is my most favourite phrase. I believe, hard working is the key
              of success. So i never compromize with hard work. By maintaining
              Punctuality, Morality and hard working, i will surely become a
              well known full Stack web developer in future
